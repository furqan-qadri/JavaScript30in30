# JavaScript30in30
This repo contains projects that I made while taking the JavaScript 30 projects in 30 days course by. This course focuses solely on building small to medium sized projects in using vanilla JS i.e without the use of any frameworks etc. Used just HTML,CSS and JS to create these cool projects which have real life application. Check'em out!
